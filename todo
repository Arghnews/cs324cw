-- make sat work with rotations - requires writing a function to return vertices of shape
taking into account rotation, ie. will need to move them
-- think need to take cross product of all edges as well as face normals?
-- try crossing all the face normals


-- two issues one is zero -> doesn't work at no rotate I think - nan issue with axis normalize
-- second is possibly representation, the graphical representation and the collision are different
going to make them same
disabling rotates for cuboid and graphical
